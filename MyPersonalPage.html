        A Little Bit About Me
    </h1>
    <p>
        My college career has been a wild ride. From going from a Film Major all the way to Management Information Systems, 
        I have experienced a lot that has prepared me for the unexpected nature of the road ahead. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Being a film major, I was able to retain that creativeness that continues to drive me to make fascinating and unique projects. 
        I carry that creativity everywhere with me; whether it is as an individual or group project, I will always look for ways to think outside of the box.
        I believe my love for learning new things is an important skill that I will continue to exemplify throughout my career. 
        Changing majors in such a dramatic fashion was challenging at first. Throughout the first year in MIS I was overwhelmed - honestly -
        I still am from time to time. Being in such a fast-paced, ever-changing industry like IT will overwhelm anyone. But that's the beauty of it, there's always more to learn and I love it. 
        You can never stop improving your skills. Whether it is learning a new language of code, software, or technology; you simply cannot stop growing. In any situation, 
        I crave to be an expert in whatever it might be. I am competitive by nature. I won't stop continuously trying to improve until I feel like I have mastered it.
