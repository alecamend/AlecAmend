      My Name is Alec Clayton Amend,
The purpose of this sight is to offer an insight on who I am as a person, student, and a future employee.

I am a Management Information Systems major at The University of Oklahoma. It's crazy to think how far I have come
starting as a Film Major, not knowing of the journey I had laid ahead of me.

Throughout my website, I hope to offer more about who I am through my experiences, skills, and what I can bring to the table.
