## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/alecamend/alecamend.io/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown


# My Name is Alec Clayton Amend,
## The purpose of this sight is to offer an insight on who I am as a person, student, and a future employee.

I am a Management Information Systems major at The University of Oklahoma. It's crazy to think how far I have come
starting as a Film Major, not knowing of the journey I had laid ahead of me.

Throughout my website, I hope to offer more about who I am through my experiences, skills, and what I can bring to the table.


```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/alecamend/alecamend.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
